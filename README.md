# World-Economic-Indicator-Excel
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is creating a department under its name which will focus on how a country can attain sustainable growth. I as a data analyst determine which factors a country should focus on to sustain GDP/ Capita.

Undertaking the "World Economic Indicator" project as the Data Analyst, While unraveling the path to sustainable GDP per capita, my approach and achievements are summarized below:

Approach:
Employing advanced Excel techniques, I seamlessly merged diverse datasets using VLOOKUP. I then meticulously imputed missing values while ensuring temporal consistency by replacing gaps with prior year data. This tailored transformation safeguarded data integrity.

Insights:
Delving into multifaceted data dimensions such as CO2 emissions, foreign activities, and healthcare spending, I unearthed pivotal insights. This granular analysis revealed intricate interdependencies shaping a country's economic trajectory.

My data analysis proficiency, coupled with adept Excel skills, was instrumental in this project's success. Transitioning from digital marketing, I am poised to leverage these capabilities to contribute meaningfully in a data analysis role.
